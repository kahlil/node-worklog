# worklog

Log work to files in `~/Dropbox/worklog`.
The name of the file you are logging your work to is determined by the first
argument you pass and the message you log is determined by the message
you pass in the format of `-m <MESSAGE>`.

## TODO:
* write tests
* make the tool less brittle

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install -g worklog`

And use it like this:

```sh
worklog 2014-03-17 -m 'What I did today'
```
